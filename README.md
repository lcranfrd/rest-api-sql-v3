# rest-api-sql-v3
 TreeHouse FSTD Project #9

This is an Express/Sequelize/Sqlite-3 API project without HTML.

To run the project you will first need to run 'npm run seed'. Then run 'npm start'.
This will allow a minimal clean database that will allow the preset tests to function for the first time.

To test the project you would:

1: Use an API testing platform such as Postman, https://www.postman.com or
2: Use the 'test.http' file for preset route tests.

The callback functions for the routes under the routes directory have been placed in the middleware/routeCallbacks.js file for easier listing.
